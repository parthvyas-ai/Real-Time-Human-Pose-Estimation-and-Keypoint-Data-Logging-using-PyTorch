Real-Time Human Pose Estimation and Keypoint Data Logging using PyTorch
In this project I have Implemented using PyTorch Keypoint R-CNN with ResNet-50 FPN backbone, accelerated on Apple M1 GPU (MPS). Also it Automatically log joint coordinates into CSV format, enabling use cases in sports performance analysis. Delivered overlay-annotated video outputs with live FPS monitoring, supporting deployment for edge devices.
